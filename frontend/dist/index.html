        content="Urban Steps is a website and online directory that helps people discover and get involved in local dance studios in their area. I have always been interested in combining my passion for dance and technical skills so I built this project to combine the two! A lot of dance studios in my area currently do not have their own websites, so this project's purpose was to resolve basic interactions a dance studio and student would want."
